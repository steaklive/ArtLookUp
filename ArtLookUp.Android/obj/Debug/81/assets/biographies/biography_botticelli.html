<p>Early years</p>
<p></p>
<p>Details about Botticelli's personal life are sparse, but his prolific professional career is well documented due to the stunning heights of his fame.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Botticelli's career started at age 14, where he was apprenticed to Fra Filippo Lippi who had a noticeable effect on his painting style and many historians are keen to note that he adopted Lippi's intimate and detailed artistic technique. Such delicate expressions on the faces of Botticelli's models in addition to his decorative approach led to his growing notoriety as an artist.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Botticelli's rising talent meant that by the age of 15 he was able to open a workshop of his own. Such a development of talent led to a distinctive artistic style, which was epitomized by life-like figures with a sad or melancholic style. Perhaps one of the most striking aspects of his work that definitely lent to his popularity at the time was his incorporation of Neo-Platonism. The method meant that he could appeal to many tastes by including Christianity and paganism in his works.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Many historians note that Botticelli suffered from unrequited love towards the model of his Birth of Venus painting. Despite this popular claim the artist was at one point in his life charged with sodomy and the summary of the charge noted that "Botticelli keeps a boy".</p>
