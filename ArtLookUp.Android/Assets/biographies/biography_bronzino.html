    <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Early years</strong></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Bronzino was born November 17, 1503, in the town of Monticello outside Florence to a poor family. He started his art education at the age of 11 as a pupil of Raffaellino del Garbo, a Florentine Renaissance painter. In 1515 Bronzino undertook an apprenticeship in Florence with the man who would become his biggest artistic influence and, some say, adopted father: Jacopo Carucci, better known as Pontormo.<br /><br />In 1522 when Bronzino was 19 years old, the plague broke out in Florence so he and Pontormo left the heart of the city to avoid the Black Death and stayed three miles away at Certosa di Galuzzo, a cloistered Carthusian monastery.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Middle years</strong></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">In 1925, Pontormo called upon his pupil to help with what would be his masterpiece: Deposition from the Cross. This altarpiece was painted in the Florentine church of Santa Felicit&agrave;. Pontormo was commissioned to decorate the entire church with frescoes and in a testament to Pontormo's trust in and affection for Bronzino he allowed him to help him once again.<br /><br />Bronzino fled to Urbino after the Siege of Florence in 1530 after being invited there by the Duke of Urbino to paint a nude Cupid on a spandrel of a vault of the Imperiale. Soon after he arrived, Pontormo wrote letter after letter asking Bronzino to come back. Yet, a prince at Urbino was so impressed with Bronzino's painting that he commissioned him to paint his portrait. Once it was finished, Bronzino rejoined his teacher in Florence.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Advanced years</strong></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">As Bronzino began to be known for his portraits, the nobility in Florence took note. He became the official portraitist for the Medici and soon went to work painting the portraits of the ruling family members, which he is now largely known for, and which is Bronzino's greatest contribution to Mannerism.<br /><br />Bronzino had many students as he worked as court painter, a role he fulfilled until his death, but none as favored as Alessandro Allori. In a move that mirrored his relationship with Pontormo, Bronzino adopted Allori as his son. Bronzino moved into the Allori family house and died there on November 23, 1572, at the age of 69.</p>
