    <p style="text-align: justify;">It is unknown exactly when and where Jan van Eyck was born but the first record of payment to the artist was documented by The Hague in. 1422. Van Eyck was working for the Count of Holland, John III as the official painter and therefore this puts Jan's birth around 1390 or a little bit before. It's thought he was born in the town of Maaseik.<br /><br />Jan van Eyck had around five brothers and sisters, all of them artists.<br /><br />His earliest known work is thought to be Adoration of the Magi which was copied in a drawing. The clothing of the kings dates back to c. 1420.<br /><br />It is unknown where van Eyck studied painting but according to northern European and Flemish tradition, he probably studied under his brother, Herbert.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Middle years</strong></span></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">After the Count's death, van Eyck began working for the Duke Philip the Good of Burgundy on May 19th 1425, a patron who would continue to provide financially for Eyck and his family even after the artist's death.<br /><br />Working for the Duke, van Eyck was probably involved in much more than just painting, such as decorating, engraving, designing costumes, paint shields, stain banners and coloring statues.<br /><br />Jan van Eyck moved to Lille but would soon embark on the first of his many trips for the Duke, including at least two secret voyages. The first voyage was most likely to Italy in the autumn of 1425 where it is suggested that he picked up Italian influences.<br /><br />He spent the next two years in Lille working on decorating the walls at the ducal residence as the building was being redone.<br /><br />In October 1428 van Eyck accompanied the Burgundian embassy to Portugal. The Duke was asking for the hand of the eldest daughter of John I, Isabella. However, due to a storm, the boat did not arrive to Portugal until December.<br /><br />In Portugal van Eyck painted Isabella's portrait Infanta. He may have painted two versions and sent them back to Philip the Good via two groups, one travelling over land and the other over sea.<br /><br />The group made trips to Santiago de Compestela to visit John II of Castile and Muhammad IX in Grenada. The Duke agreed to the marriage and the party arrived home in December of the next year.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Advanced years</strong></span></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">In 1430 Jan van Eyck settled in Bruges and began working on the Ghent panels left unfinished by his brother. Two years later he bought a house and would stay in Bruges for the rest of his life except for a journey to Arras and a longer journey in 1436, probably to the holy lands.<br /><br />Around 1432 van Eyck married Margaret, of whom there is only one portrait of, and had at least two children.<br /><br />Although under the call of the Duke, Jan received commissions from churches and other persons such as the Arnolfini Portrait of 1434.<br /><br />Around this time he also began to create portraits. Such works are unique as they focus in on the subject with a light source usually from the left. The figures are turned three-quarters towards the light hiding the left cheek in shadow.<br /><br />In 1445 Jan was commissioned by Nicholas van Maelbeke to paint a triptych which was never completed. The date of the artist's death is unknown but it's presumed that he died while painting the triptych.</p>
