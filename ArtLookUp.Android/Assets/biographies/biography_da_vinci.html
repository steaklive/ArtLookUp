    <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Early years</strong></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Leonardo da Vinci was born on April 15 1452, in Vinci, in the region of Florence, Italy. The illegitimate son of Messer Piero Fruosino di Antonio da Vinci, a wealthy Florentine legal representative, and Caterina, a peasant woman, Leonardo had no surname - 'da Vinci' simply means 'of Vinci'.</span><br /><br /><span style="color: #000000;">Little information exists concerning Leonardo's early life but it's known that his parents separated and he spent time living with both. His mother remarried and both parents had children with their respective partners, meaning Leonardo had a total of 17 half brothers and sisters.</span><br /><br /><span style="color: #000000;">Growing up in his father's Vinci home, Leonardo was immersed in the town's painting tradition, and at the age of 15 he took up an apprenticeship with Andrea del Verrocchio whose workshop was highly esteemed in Florence in particular. Other renowned painters who attended it include Botticelli, Perugino, Domenico Ghirlandaio and Lorenzo di Credi.</span><br /><br /><span style="color: #000000;">Vasari claims that Leonardo shined as an apprentice and often assisted his master with his commissions, most notably Baptism of Christ. Da Vinci was given the task of painting the young angel holding Jesus' robe and Vasari states that his work excelled that of his teacher, so much so that Verrocchio vowed never to paint again.</span><br /><br /><span style="color: #000000;">By the age of twenty Leonardo qualified as a master in the Guild of&nbsp;<a style="color: #000000; text-decoration: underline;" title="St Luke" href="https://www.artble.com/artists/frans_hals/paintings/st_luke">St Luke</a>, the union of artists and doctors. His father established a workshop for him but he continued painting with Verrocchio, the two clearly sharing a close bond. Leonardo's first recognized work is a pen and ink drawing of the Arno valley, which he finished on August 5, 1473.</span><br /><br /><span style="color: #000000;">Leonardo spent the next ten years working in Florence. Few of his paintings from this period survive but he created several drawings that demonstrated his keen interest in other disciplines, such as anatomy, geometry and engineering.</span><br /><br /><span style="color: #000000;">After ten years he relocated to Milan, believing it harbored more exciting opportunities. There he was commissioned by a confraternity to create an altarpiece, the result being&nbsp;<a style="color: #000000; text-decoration: underline;" title="The Virgin of the Rocks" href="https://www.artble.com/artists/leonardo_da_vinci/paintings/the_virgin_of_the_rocks">The Virgin of the Rocks</a>.</span></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Middle years</strong></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Leonardo's major achievement from this time was The Last Supper, which perfectly illustrates his belief that poses, gestures and facial expressions should mirror the motions of the soul and mind. Similarly, his portrait Mona Lisa was immensely popular thanks to the sitter's mysterious expression.<br /><br />The artist's stay in Milan lasted until 1513 and after that he spent three years in Rome. At some point during this period he was offered employment as 'first painter and engineer' at the royal court which he accepted. He moved to the Chateau of Cloux, near Amboise in 1517 and remained there for the rest of his life.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Advanced years</strong></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Ill health plagued Leonardo and a stroke left him paralyzed down the right side of his body. Nevertheless, he kept busy and relied on his assistants to carry out most of the physical work. However, his mood worsened and it's thought that he was overwhelmed by cynicism.<br /><br />Da Vinci dedicated more time to his experiments and scientific assignments which hindered his artistic commissions and he finished less and less of his work. He completed so few paintings during his career that it was hard to decipher his original works from imitations and copies.<br /><br />In April 1519 a 67-year-old Leonardo devised a will and left the majority of his collection to his acclaimed pupil and companion, Francesco Melzi. He died later that year and was buried in Amboise. Vasari records that King Francis, a trusted friend of the artist, held his head in his arms as he died but others contest this.</p>
