    <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Early years</strong></span></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Titian was born in around 1485 in the small town of Pieve di Cadore in the Dolomite Mountains, a former holding of the Venetian Republic. He came from a family that boasted numerous prominent members of local government - magistrates, mayors and ambassadors - as well as several artists.</span><br /><br /><span style="color: #000000;">Titian's elder brother, Francesco Vecellio, left home to train as a painter in Venice and became a respected artist soon after. Titian himself was brought to Venice around the age of 10 to be apprenticed to a mosaicist, Sebastiano Zuccati.</span><br /><br /><span style="color: #000000;">His time with Zuccati was short, however, and young Titian soon found himself apprenticed to Gentile Bellini, of the illustrious Bellini family of Venetian painters.</span><br /><br /><span style="color: #000000;">For reasons unknown, Titian transferred apprenticeships for the third time and joined the workshop of Gentile's brother, Giovanni Bellini, the artist credited with introducing the sensuous Venetian style to Italy. It would be the lessons learned in Giovanni&nbsp;<a style="color: #000000;" title="Bellini" href="https://www.artble.com/artists/giovanni_bellini">Bellini</a>'s workshop that would provide Titian with a solid foundation for the rest of his life.</span><br /><br /><span style="color: #000000;">While apprenticed under Bellini, Titian met Giorgio Barbarelli da Castelfranco, commonly known as Giorgione, one of the artists that best represented the Venetian style of painting.</span><br /><br /><span style="color: #000000;">Titian admired Giorgione as a person and artist, and the two frequently collaborated on works. This has made attributing and dating Titian's early pieces exceedingly difficult for modern scholars, as they share similar features with Giorgione's or are signed by one of them when it seems both contributed.</span><br /><br /><span style="color: #000000;">Some of Titian's earliest works include a fresco of Hercules on the Morosini Palace, the Gypsy Madonna, and the Visitation of Mary and Elizabeth.</span></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Middle years</strong></span></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">By the time Giorgione died, possibly of the plague, in 1510, a twenty-something Titian had already made a strong name for himself on the Venetian art scene. With his training essentially complete, he and Bellini occupied the pinnacle of Venetian painting.</span><br /><br /><span style="color: #000000;">During the middle of his career, Titian busied himself with the numerous commissions he received to paint altarpieces and frescoes. His first commission, and the one that ultimately launched his career, was to paint three frescoes for the Scuola del Santo in Padua.</span><br /><br /><span style="color: #000000;">Like his teacher, Bellini, Titian was also granted the honor of working in the Doge's Palace in Venice, painting large depictions of historical and religious scenes. Unfortunately, much of his painstaking effort in the palace was destroyed by fire in 1577.</span><br /><br /><span style="color: #000000;">Along with his work in Venice, Titian was concurrently working for the courts in Ferrara and Mantua, and had little free time. He gained these positions after spending a month working for Alfonso I, Duke of Ferrara on a few mythology paintings, perhaps alongside his former teacher, who had also been commissioned by the duke.</span><br /><br /><span style="color: #000000;">When Bellini died in 1516, Titian assumed the role of prominent painter in Venice and kept it for the next sixty years until his death.</span><br /><br /><span style="color: #000000;">In 1525, Titian married a young woman named Cecilia, with whom he already had one child, Pomponio. The couple went on to have two more children, a son and Titian's future assistant Orazio, and a daughter, Lavinia. Sadly, Cecilia died in 1530 while giving birth to Lavinia.</span><br /><br /><span style="color: #000000;">After his wife's untimely death, a change in Titian's style became quite apparent. Where he had once preferred bright juxtaposing colors and fluid, dynamic scenes, he now employed a more restrained style, using related hues.</span></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Advanced years</strong></span></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">For the ensuing decades, Titian became employed in a number of the European royal courts including Rome, Urbino, Naples, the Holy Roman Empire and Spain for which he painted dozens of mythologies, portraits and religious scenes. It was during this time that he painted some of his most well-known and celebrated works, including Danae, Diana and Actaeon, the Death of Actaeon and the Rape of Europa.</span><br /><br /><span style="color: #000000;">The last 26 years of Titian's life were almost entirely devoted to King Philip II of Spain, though he did make time to complete a number of works for patrons in Venice, such as those for the Doge's Palace.&nbsp;</span></p>
