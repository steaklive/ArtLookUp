    <p style="text-align: justify;">Hieronymus Bosch was born Jeroen Anthoniszoon van Aken but took his name from the place he lived and worked, 's-Hertogenbosch, commonly referred to as 'Den Bosch'. Bosch's ancestors had settled in the Dutch city in the late 14th or early 15th century and their family name, Van Aken, implies that they originated from the German town of Aachen.<br /><br />Bosch's grandfather, Jan van Aken, was a painter who had five sons, four of whom went on to become artists. Bosch's father, Anthonius van Aken, is known to have worked as an artistic adviser to the Brotherhood of Our Lady which was one of several groups devoted to the worship of the Virgin during the late middle ages.<br /><br />The exact date of Hieronymus Bosch's birth is questionable but it's thought to have been around 1450 due to a hand drawn portrait (possibly a self-portrait) produced just before Bosch's death in 1516. The drawing depicts the artist in his old age, probably in his late sixties.<br /><br />The first mention of Hieronymus Bosch is in a municipal record in 1474, when he is named along with his siblings - two brothers and a sister. One of his brothers, Goossen, was also a painter. It's likely that Bosch received his artistic training from his father or one of his uncles but none of their works exist today.<br /><br />In 1463, 4,000 houses in 's-Hertogenbosch were destroyed by a disastrous fire, an incident that the young Bosch presumably witnessed. Such an experience may have impacted on his choice of subject matter later on in his career but to this day little is known about Bosch's personality or artistic preferences.<br /><br />Despite his pessimistic paintings, he was popular during his career and often gained commissions from abroad.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Middle years</strong></span></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Bosch married Aleyt Goyaerts van den Meerveen sometime between 1479 and 1481. She was a little older than the artist and came from a wealthy family. The couple moved to the nearby town of Oirschot as Aleyt had inherited a house and land there.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Advanced years</strong></span></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Between 1486 and 1487, Bosch's name first appeared in the membership lists of the Brotherhood of Our Lady, which was by now a large and affluent organization that commissioned works to decorate the chapel of Our Lady. Most of Bosch's family belonged to the Brotherhood, fulfilling various roles throughout the years.<br /><br />As there is little written evidence of Bosch's life, such as letters or diaries, much of what is known about the artist has come from references to him in the municipal records of 's-Hertogenbosch, as well as the account books of the Brotherhood of Our Lady.<br /><br />Bosch's death is recorded in an entry in the accounts of the Brotherhood of Our Lady in 1516 and his funeral took place in the church of Saint John on 9 August that year.</p>
