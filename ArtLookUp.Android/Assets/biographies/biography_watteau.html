    <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Early years</strong></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Little is known about the early years of Watteau's life and details of his family life and upbringing are scarce. Though, it has been said that his menacing father was a roofer and that the financial position of his family was a modest one.<br /><br />The artist's life is chronicled in greater depth after his move to Paris in 1702.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Middle years</strong></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">As for most artists, Paris was where the excitement began for Watteau. Here his artistic ability grew and his unique style developed. Watteau's first job at a workshop painting reproductions of popular Dutch artists aided in the development of his characteristic sketch-like technique.<br /><br />In 1704, he became the assistant of Claude Gillot, an artist who favored the more official and serious art of Louis XIV. Gillot was a set designer and acquainted young Watteau with the Commedia dell'Arte. Watteau wholeheartedly embraced the characters of the Italian theater, an influence that would last throughout his short career.<br /><br />Watteau's second apprenticeship was with an interior designer by the name of Claude Audran III. Through Audran, Watteau was exposed not only to Rococo design ideals but to the work of Peter Paul Rubens which remained influential throughout Watteau's life.<br /><br />Aiming to create his own original work, Watteau entered the Prix de Rome (a scholarship for art students) at the Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture in 1709. He didn't win but gained the recognition of the Academy's president upon his second entrance.<br /><br />In 1712, he was granted the chance to submit work for admission into the Academy. After completing his submissions piece,&nbsp;<a title="Embarkation for Cythera" href="https://www.artble.com/artists/antoine_watteau/paintings/embarkation_for_cythera">Embarkation for Cythera</a>&nbsp;five years later, Watteau was granted full admission. Furthermore, as Watteau's style did not fit into any preexisting categories at the Academy, he was accepted under his own genre,&nbsp;<em>"fete gallants"</em>&nbsp;or grand themes.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Later years</strong></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">During his final years Watteau continued painting acclaimed pieces. After being diagnosed with tuberculosis, his health continued to decline and resulted in his untimely death on July 18, 1721, at the age of 36.</p>
