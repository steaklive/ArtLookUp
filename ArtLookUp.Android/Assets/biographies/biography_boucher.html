    <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Early years</strong></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Boucher was the son of a lace designer. His natural artistic skill was apparent early, and he was apprenticed to an engraver at age 17. Within three years he had earned an extremely prestigious scholarship, the Grand Prix de Rome. This would allow him to study art in Rome with some of the greatest masters of the world, although he did not take up that opportunity until four years later.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">When Boucher eventually did return from his study of art in Italy he was given a position at the Acad&eacute;mie de peinture et de sculpture, where he could work as a painter, and also as a teacher of art. This position led directly to a position as &ldquo;First Painter of the King&rdquo; &ndash; although this latter honor did not occur until 1965 when Boucher was 63 years old.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Middle/Advanced years</strong></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">But in his decades as one of the greatest working artists in France (and all of Europe) Boucher produced an enormous body of work &mdash; his paintings were destined to define an entire age.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Boucher&rsquo;s huge canvases often depict idyllic, natural scenes that are serene. It&rsquo;s as if all of his subjects were rich, French, but living in the proverbial Garden of Eden. Clearly, however, Boucher had an edge. That is, while his scenes were idyllic, they were not always innocent. Many of his paintings are erotic, suggestive and display passionate interactions between men and women, and even women and other women. This work eventually landed him in hot water with important people who felt that Boucher&rsquo;s worked bordered on &ndash; or was &ndash; too suggestive.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Commissions to create portrait work for high-powered aristocrats were an important part of Boucher&rsquo;s life work. These assignments paid well, and his ability to capture the humanity and essence of his subjects should be considered second to none.</p>
