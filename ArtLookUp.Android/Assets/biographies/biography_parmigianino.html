    <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Early years</strong></span></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Born in Parma, Italy, in the year 1503, Parmigianino came from a family of artists. Orphaned at the age of two, he was brought up by his two uncles who were established artists in Parma and saw to his early artistic education. From an early age Parmigianino showed an exceptional talent and often helped his uncles with their local fresco commissions.</span><br /><br /><span style="color: #000000;">Parmigianino's early paintings show the pervasive influence of Correggio. These include&nbsp;<a style="color: #000000;" title="The Mystic Marriage of Saint Catherine" href="https://www.artble.com/artists/parmigianino/paintings/the_mystic_marriage_of_saint_catherine">The Mystic Marriage of Saint Catherine</a>&nbsp;and the frescoes in San Giovanni Evangelista, where both artists painted.</span></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Middle years</strong></span></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Like many artists before him, Parmigianino moved to Rome in 1524 to seek out fame and fortune. The city was the epicenter of artistic antiquities and a place where young artists could study and gain&nbsp;<a style="color: #000000;" title="inspiration" href="https://www.artble.com/artists/jean-honore_fragonard/paintings/inspiration">inspiration</a>&nbsp;from the work of the great masters, Raphael and Michelangelo. In Rome, Parmigianino presented his&nbsp;<a style="color: #000000;" title="Self-Portrait in a Convex Mirror" href="https://www.artble.com/artists/parmigianino/paintings/self-portrait_in_a_convex_mirror">Self-Portrait in a Convex Mirror</a>&nbsp;to the Papal court, hoping to gain commissions and was immediately celebrated as 'Raphael reborn'.</span></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Advanced years</strong></span></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Parmigianino was forced to flee Rome when the city was destroyed by German troops in 1527. Three years later Parmigianino returned to Parma, where he was a hailed as a local hero and easily gained work. However, in his later years, Parmigianino's eccentricities and obsession with alchemy got the better of him and he steadily declined.</span><br /><br /><span style="color: #000000;">In 1537, he was imprisoned for failing to complete some of his artistic obligations. Obtaining bail he fled to Casal Maggiore, where he ended his days in exile and disgrace. He was just 37 years old when he died.</span></p>
