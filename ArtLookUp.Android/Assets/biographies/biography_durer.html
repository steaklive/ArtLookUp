    <p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Early years</strong></span></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Albrecht Durer was the son of a Hungarian goldsmith, with the same name. His father moved to Germany in 1455 and married Barbara Holper in 1467. Albrecht was born in 1471 and it's believed he was one of around 14 children.</span><br /><br /><span style="color: #000000;">Although there was a rich goldsmith heritage within the family Albrecht began painting around the age of 13, drawing&nbsp;<a style="color: #000000;" title="inspiration" href="https://www.artble.com/artists/jean-honore_fragonard/paintings/inspiration">inspiration</a>&nbsp;from the people around him.</span><br /><br /><span style="color: #000000;">Durer began an apprenticeship under the German printmaker and painter Michael Wolgemut aged just 15. Wolgemut was an expert in woodcuts and paintings and at the time he was one of the best artists in Nuremberg, which was a strong and influential city at the heart of Germany with links to Italy and the Alps.</span><br /><br /><span style="color: #000000;">Durer completed his first work, a self-portrait, in 1484. He left Germany six years later for a 'wanderjahre,' what is now referred to as a gap year or year to travel.</span></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Middle years</strong></span></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The full details of his travels are unknown however it is likely that he headed to Frankfurt, Holland and Strasbourg where he painted self-portraits for the first time.</span><br /><br /><span style="color: #000000;">In 1492 Durer visited Basel in Switzerland to see the Schongauer brothers (Martin and Georg) before returning to Nuremberg and marrying Agnes Frey in 1494. They had no children.</span><br /><br /><span style="color: #000000;">Durer remained in Nuremberg for just three months before heading to Italy. His journey took him across the Alps and he used that time to make sketches using watercolors. This was the first of two visits the artist made to the southern European country.</span><br /><br /><span style="color: #000000;">Next Durer headed to Venice as he looked to broaden his artistic world at one of the homes of the Renaissance before heading to Mantua and Padua. He returned to Nuremberg in 1495 and stayed there for a decade.</span><br /><br /><span style="color: #000000;">Durer opened a workshop and began developing his skills and portfolio. During the first years of this venture he created woodcut prints that were based mainly around religion, such as The Men's Bath House (1496) which were impressive in both composition and complexity.</span><br /><br /><span style="color: #000000;">Whether Durer cut the wood himself is debatable but his training as an apprentice meant that he understood the technique. In 1502 the artist lost his father and his mother died in 1513.</span><br /><br /><span style="color: #000000;">Burin (engraving tool) and engravings were the next skills that Durer trained to use, although he may have gained an understanding from his father. He first demonstrated this technique in his Prodigal Son.</span><br /><br /><span style="color: #000000;">Other innovative pieces followed as Durer used landscapes and animals as subjects whilst also creating religious figures. These prints soon made him famous across Europe.</span><br /><br /><span style="color: #000000;">The famous Venetian artist Jacopo de Barbari was a close friend of Durer's and praised his work but Durer contined studying and learning. Drawings on human proportion were next on his agenda and works created at this time include the engraving Adam and Eve.</span><br /><br /><span style="color: #000000;">Although engravings preoccupied his thoughts, Durer also continued to create bodycolor and watercolors such as Great Piece of Turf and&nbsp;<a style="color: #000000;" title="Young Hare" href="https://www.artble.com/artists/albrecht_durer/engravings/young_hare">Young Hare</a>.</span><br /><br /><span style="color: #000000;">A stint in Italy between 1505 and 1507 saw Durer return to painting, mainly on linen using tempera. Altarpieces and portraits were the main products, namely&nbsp;<a style="color: #000000;" title="the Adoration of the Magi" href="https://www.artble.com/artists/leonardo_da_vinci/drawings/the_adoration_of_the_magi">the Adoration of the Magi</a>&nbsp;and the Paumgartner altarpiece.</span><br /><br /><span style="color: #000000;">In Venice in 1506 Durer created the Adoration of the Virgin (also known as the Feast of Rose Garlands) on commission for the San Bartolomeo church which then found its way to Prague. Other pieces created at this time include Christ disputing with the Doctors and&nbsp;<a style="color: #000000;" title="The Virgin and Child" href="https://www.artble.com/artists/tommaso_cassai_masaccio/paintings/the_virgin_and_child">The Virgin and Child</a>&nbsp;with the Goldfinch.</span><br /><br /><span style="color: #000000;">Albrecht Durer's popularity rose in Italy (he was now an acquaintance of Giovanni Bellini, Leonardo da Vinci and Raphael) but he felt the need to return to Germany, where he created his most renowned artworks.</span><br /><br /><span style="color: #000000;">Woodcuts of the Life of the Virgin and Great Passion were also created to showcase developments in Durer's modeling and style. It was from 1513 until 1514 that his most famous engravings were produced, such as The Knight, Death, and the Devil.</span><br /><br /><span style="color: #000000;">In around 1512 Durer had befriended Maximilian I and this led to his commission for many works including The Triumphal Arch which was created on 192 different blocks. This was followed with Triumphal Procession.</span></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Advanced years</strong></span></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Maximilian I was Albrecht Durer's major patron but died in 1520. Charles V, the new Emperor, then took over this patronage and the artist was well-received, creating charcoal, silverpoint and chalk drawings whilst also gaining knowledge from fellow artists.</span><br /><br /><span style="color: #000000;">It's thought that Durer went to Brussels in order to paint Christian II of Denmark. There he was able to view Aztec treasure and said that it was&nbsp;<em>"more beautiful to me than miracles"</em>.</span><br /><br /><span style="color: #000000;">1521 saw his return to Germany and his work slowed as he did. His later life was largely based on religious themes for great projects such as Sacra Conversazione and Crucifixion and he also began writing about perspective, fortification, proportions and geometry. His first book was published in 1525, entitled The Four Books on Measurement. It was a work on mathematics for adults and was followed in 1527 by The Four Books on Human Proportion, based on city fortifications.</span><br /><br /><span style="color: #000000;">In 1528, at the age of 56, Albrecht Durer died leaving a considerable fortune and his house/workshop is today a Nuremberg landmark and museum. He is buried in Johannisfriedhof cemetery.</span></p>
